# Review Guide

Quick reviewer path for Receipt-to-Form.

## What To Review First

1. Run the app locally using the commands below. See the README for the existing hosted demo.
2. Upload one to five receipt images.
3. Select the files to process and click **Extract**.
4. Open the preview modal to inspect the uploaded image.
5. Expand a completed or needs-review row.
6. For `Needs review`, compare the inline receipt preview with the editable fields and fix missing values.
7. Confirm complete rows show a download icon.
8. Download one result or selected complete results as JSON.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run ci
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:live
```

## Environment

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY` is required for real extraction. `GEMINI_MODEL` is optional.

## Engineering Highlights

- Uses a server-side API route so the Gemini key is not exposed to the browser.
- Handles file type and file size validation on the client and API boundary.
- Supports batch queue behavior without adding unnecessary backend complexity.
- Treats AI extraction as a draft and keeps human review in the loop.
- Distinguishes failed extraction from partial extraction.
- Requires manual correction for incomplete AI fields before download.
- Shows inline receipt preview during review to reduce user friction.
- Validates required receipt fields before a result becomes downloadable.
- Separates deterministic CI tests from live AI validation.
- Documents deployment, testing, and known MVP limits.

## Known Scope

The app intentionally keeps queue state in the browser and uses a single extraction API route. Durable persistence, authentication, PDF support, real Google Drive upload, URL upload, and accounting-system integrations are outside this portfolio version.
