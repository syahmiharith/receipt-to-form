# Receipt-to-Form

Gemini-powered receipt extraction and human-review web app. The app turns receipt images into structured, reviewable data through a CloudConvert-style processing queue: upload receipts, extract selected files, review uncertain fields, and download only complete JSON outputs.

**Run the app:** follow [Getting Started](#getting-started).

**Existing hosted demo:** <https://tp-intern-malaysia.vercel.app/> (legacy deployment address; hosting has not been renamed).

**Walkthrough:** [Demo Script](./docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md). The earlier recording is retained in Git history, not presented as a current UI demonstration.

## Quick Path

1. Start the local app or open the existing hosted demo.
2. Upload one to five JPG, PNG, or WEBP receipt images.
3. Select the files to process and click **Extract**.
4. Preview receipts, review extracted fields, and fix any `Needs review` result using the inline receipt preview.
5. Confirm complete rows show a download action.
6. Download per-receipt JSON or selected complete JSON results.

## Why This Is More Than An API Call

The workflow combines receipt upload, generative AI extraction, editable review, and structured output in a human-in-the-loop extraction queue.

Key product decisions:

- AI creates the first draft; the user remains responsible for uncertain or incomplete fields.
- Batch queue UX supports up to five receipts while keeping extraction sequential to reduce quota risk.
- Download is available only when the required structured fields are complete.
- The backend stays small: one secure `POST /api/extract-receipt` route handles validation, rate limiting, and Gemini calls.

## What I Built

- Upload queue for up to five receipt images.
- Supported files: JPG, PNG, WEBP, max 5MB each.
- Auto-selection for newly uploaded files.
- Preview modal for every uploaded receipt.
- Selected-file extraction with sequential API calls.
- Item-level extracting, extracted, needs-review, failed, and edited states.
- Bottom-edge progress indicator and left-edge result status indicator.
- Receipt type classification.
- Extraction of merchant name, date, total amount, currency, confidence, notes, and line items.
- Editable details panel for manual correction.
- Inline receipt preview inside `Needs review` details so users can compare the image while fixing fields.
- Red validation states for missing required fields.
- JSON download only for complete results.
- Batch JSON download that includes only selected complete results.

## Engineering Signals

| Area | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| API key safety | Gemini key is used only in the server-side API route. |
| Input validation | File type and size are checked before extraction. |
| Output validation | Gemini output is parsed, normalized, and validated with Zod. |
| Human review | Low-confidence or incomplete results become `Needs review`. |
| Abuse protection | In-memory per-IP rate limit allows 15 extractions per minute. |
| Test strategy | Default tests mock Gemini for deterministic CI. |
| Real integration | Optional live Gemini Playwright smoke test validates the real API path. |
| Deployment readiness | Vercel build, analytics, speed insights, and safe error messages are included. |

## AI Model And Prompt

The API uses Gemini through `POST /api/extract-receipt`. By default, the app uses:

```bash
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

The extraction prompt asks Gemini to return strict JSON only, with these fields:

- `merchantName`
- `receiptType`
- `currency`
- `totalAmount`
- `date`
- `confidence`
- `notes`
- `items`

Important prompt rules:

- Do not guess unreadable values.
- Use `null` for missing or unclear fields.
- Classify receipt type into a fixed category list.
- Format dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` when possible.
- Return line items only when visible.
- Add short uncertainty notes for blurry, hidden, or ambiguous fields.

## API Contract

### `POST /api/extract-receipt`

Request:

- `multipart/form-data`
- field: `receipt`
- accepted MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`
- max size: `5MB`

Success:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "merchantName": "AEON Wellness",
    "receiptType": "Groceries",
    "currency": "MYR",
    "totalAmount": 43.8,
    "date": "2026-05-12",
    "confidence": "high",
    "notes": [],
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "Gardenia Bread",
        "quantity": 1,
        "value": 3.8
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Partial extraction still returns `200` with missing values as `null` and `confidence: "low"`. The frontend then marks the row as `Needs review`.

Error:

```json
{
  "code": "FILE_TOO_LARGE",
  "error": "Receipt image must be 5MB or smaller."
}
```

Current error codes:

```text
NO_RECEIPT_UPLOADED
INVALID_FILE_TYPE
FILE_TOO_LARGE
RATE_LIMITED
AI_PROVIDER_ERROR
INVALID_AI_RESPONSE
UNKNOWN_ERROR
```

The AI handles uncertain visual extraction. Deterministic application code owns validation, completeness rules, UI state, downloads, and safe failure handling.

## Reliability And Security

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is never exposed to the browser.
- Uploads are restricted to JPG, PNG, and WEBP on both client and server.
- Files above 5MB are rejected before extraction.
- Gemini responses are parsed and validated before reaching the UI.
- Required fields must be valid before a result becomes downloadable.
- `Needs review` results show red field-level validation and inline receipt preview.
- API failures return machine-readable error codes with safe public messages.
- Gemini requests use a timeout so the route does not wait indefinitely.
- Repeated extraction requests are rate limited per client IP.
- The app logs lifecycle events without logging API keys or image contents.
- Basic security headers are configured.

## Testing

Fast CI-style gate:

```bash
npm run ci
```

Full deterministic local gate:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

Individual checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run audit:prod
```

Live Gemini smoke test:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:live
```

The default E2E suite mocks `/api/extract-receipt`, so it is deterministic and does not spend Gemini quota. The live command uses the real API route and should be run before recording the final demo.

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for the full coverage map.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add Gemini configuration:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

Run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. Add environment variables:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `GEMINI_MODEL` optional
4. Deploy.
5. Open the production URL and run one live receipt extraction.

## Limitations And Next Steps

- Only image receipts are supported; PDF support is intentionally out of scope.
- Extraction quality depends on receipt clarity and Gemini availability.
- Queue state is client-side only and resets on refresh.
- Rate limiting is in-memory, and is not a distributed production limiter.
- A production version could add durable storage, authentication, OCR fallbacks, audit history, and Redis or Vercel KV rate limiting.
